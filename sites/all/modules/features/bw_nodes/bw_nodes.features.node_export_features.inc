This would be the direction that I would like to see for the site design, use of color, mood, etc.
Some more structure in columns would be nice too, having some visible or invisible lines that guide the placement of boxes, text etc.
And: Content should always have more visual weight than decoration, borders and labels.

I\\\'m totally not saying these should be the definitive guidelines for design guys. After all, I am not a designer at all. But as the start of a discussion, I think it\\\'s ok.

<blockquote>If a carpet looks too clean and expensive, noone dares to walk on it.</blockquote>
that was myself, but looks nice as a quote doesn\\\'t it :)

Examples:
<a href="http://casarobino.org">Casa Robino</a>
Right amount of casual + earthy. Green is a nice color for a site like this, and it\\\'s not too much of it. It has a decent structure (sidebar on the right, text aligned in a good way). Headlines get the visual weight they deserve. Horizontal separation lines are placed where necessary, but they are subtle enough to not drain attention.

<a href="http://couchsurfing.org">Couchsurfing</a>
Earthy colors, casual look, placement of boxes follows some invisible lines but not too rigid.
Mood: The happiness from the picture with the red inflated couch and the profile pics on the front page is far too obtrusive.

Bartik theme (currently active on bw.guaka.org)
It does not exactly look beautiful, a bit too technical, dull and boring. But at least it\\\'s not too shiny, not too polished, and has a decent structure of sidebar and text positioning.
Probably we will say goodbye to the blue some day.

<blockquote>I have some questions about the BW-Drupal migration: Will it be possible to port all of the current content from BW to the Drupal based site? Do we need to port everything?</blockquote>

It will be possible to migrate all content.  It might have different degrees of difficulties.  Andreas and I have just finished a project to migrate a big .asp site (with a lot of static content in .asp files) and our experience with that will come in pretty handy. We\\\'ll probably take a different approach, using more widely utilized modules (e.g. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/tw">Table Wizard</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/project/data">Data</a>, see also <a href="http://drupal.org/node/580650">How Data relates to Table Wizard</a>).

<blockquote>
Features like trips, blogs or chat are rarely used, but on the other hands
it would not be fair to the users if we delete their content.
</blockquote>

We should try to migrate everything but if there is only a little bit of content we might have to inform users and ask them about their opinion.  If it\\\'s really only a little bit of content we could even migrate things manually.

Note that efforts towards data migration should be delayed until we have a proper proof of concept where the basic functionality is in place.

<blockquote>
What about translations? There were many people who invested their freetime
to translate the website into many different languages. Their effort
shouldn\\\'t be in vain.
</blockquote>

Translations are essential and we will make a big effort to migrate the results into Drupal - where it makes sense.  Drupal and many often used modules (e.g. Views) are already very well translated and we should try to build with this where it makes sense.  So quite a few translation strings won\\\'t be migrated since they\\\'re already available in Drupal.  On the other hand, it will be great to find a way to feed BW translation efforts back into the bigger Drupal ecosphere.

<blockquote>
Where are the biggest challenges in the Drupal migration?
</blockquote>

I see the biggest challenge in keeping up momentum and finding a way to collaborate.  For example, I had given more people admin rights in order to achieve this but then later realized this is a mistake since it\\\'s hard to keep track of what\\\'s going on.  So the first hurdle is to divide the project into chunks that will allow people to work on their preferred parts.  For now this is limited to the theme I think, as long as we\\\'re with Bartik on this main install the theme is the most harmless part.

<h3>The concept</h3><p>Imagine arriving in a city like Paris or Mumbai and, instead of trying to find a taxi, there is somebody already waiting for you. Imagine that instead of going to eat at the place recommended by the guidebook, someone shows you their favourite restaurant. Imagine the experience staying as a personal guest of your new friend rather than sleeping in an impersonal hotel room. BeWelcome makes it possible.

                        <p>Monday there was a meeting between the Servas-to-BeWelcome project members. It involved two members of the BW board of directors (including me), one BW coder and three Servas coordinators (including the president of Servas International).<br /><br />The topic was the general roadmap for the project. A draft had been submitted a few days earlier by one Servas coordinator and we were going to discuss it and take it to a complete state. Most of the items of the roadmap were pretty trivial and were quickly agreed upon. However we ran into a disagreement on one point. The draft included the option...</p>                        </p>

                        It\\\'s been stated a couple of times on the forum and possibly written about in some forum posts: BeWelcome is relocating it\\\'s test server to one of it\\\'s members (Tobixen - many thanks!). In connection with this, you might experience some problems if you try to reach the old BV wiki or the trac pages (if you\\\'re trying to put in a bug report). Things should be up and running within a day or two again, though - so please, don\\\'t worry too much if you see some pages broken, they should be fixed again soon.                        </p>

1. Structure and completeness of imported content for whatever API functions we use.
2. Foreign keys, and the inevitable mismatch of auto-increment ids.

1. Structure and completeness of imported content.
Drupal\\\'s node_save() or entity_save() API. This API (in D6), has some expectations on the format and completeness of data (usually nested structures of associative array and vanilla stdClass objects) we want to import. If something is not working as expected, this is a place to look.

2. Foreign keys.
A lot of the relations between db tables on bw-rox site will translate into relations and references between Drupal objects. The structure will be different, and auto-increment ids will be different.
If a user location on bw-rox has a country id of 26, the same country might have an id of 111 on bw-drupal. Or it might even be a string key instead of an auto-increment id.

Solution: Maintain a map of primary keys.
For each imported piece of content, we should therefore maintain a reference to the original bw-rox object. This can be stored in an integer-valued field, or in a custom table that we have to keep up to date.
We then will use that map to alter the foreign key values on imported content.
We need to be careful with the order of things we import.
In some cases there might be circular dependencies, so we have to keep a list of postponed foreign key updates that have to be done later.

If we use existing solutions for the data migration, we need to find out if they are flexible enough to deal with these issues. Probably we will have to write some code of our own to hook into the import module. At that time I used <a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_export">Node export</a>, which does have a nice API for exactly this purpose, but as said, this does only work from Drupal to Drupal.\',
